# SMStoryboardSegueCatalog 

`SMStoryboardSegueCatalog` is a collection of custom system and third party UIStoryboard segues. I mainly gathered these for designers who want to prototype apps using storyboards with custom transitions.

## Demo

Build and run the `SMStoryboardSegueCatalog` project in Xcode to see a catalog of custom storyboard segues.

---

### Example Usage

Simply ctrl drag from a button to a destination view controller and select your custom segue from the drop down.

If you want uwwind the segue using the same custom segue you used to transition (just reversed) then just specify the class name of the custom segue in the unwind segue's identifier.

---

## Submit your custom segue

- Just add your pod to the Podfile, hook up a few of your custom segues in the example project and submit a pull request.

---

## Todo

- Look into Core Image transitions
- Create detailed tutorial on how to prototype apps using storyboards
