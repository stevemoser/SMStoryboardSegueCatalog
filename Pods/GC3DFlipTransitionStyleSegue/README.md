GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue
============================

iBooks-style 3D flip transition animation rendered in OpenGL ES 2.0 and wrapped in a UIStoryboardSegue subclass.

Features / Design
-----------------
- Uses OpenGL ES rendering instead of Core Animation for high performance (60 fps) and shader effects.
- Uses GLKit to drastically reduce the amount of OpenGL ES 2.0 code (to write and maintain).
- Inspired by Apple's 3D flip view controller transition animation, as found in iOS apps like iBooks, iTunes U and Podcasts.
- Supports different screen sizes and screen orientations.
- Quick and easy setup. See [installation](https://github.com/GlennChiu/GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue#installation).

Requirements
------------
GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue requires iOS 5.0 and above.

Installation
------------
Add the source code to your project (and image file if you want to use it). Link your target against `QuartzCore.framework`, `GLKit.framework` and `OpenGLES.framework`.

CocoaPods support: `pod 'GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue'`

If you use this class in a non-ARC project, make sure you add the -fobjc-arc compiler flag for the implementation file.

Quick setup: Just set this class as a custom segue and it'll work right away.

Customization
-------------
To change the default texture on the side, change these macros:
```objectivec
#define IMAGE_NAME  @"wood"
#define IMAGE_TYPE  @"jpg"
```

Exposed in the header file are some customization properties:

### - Depth
This property sets the depth (or thickness) of the 3D object.

```objectivec
@property (assign, nonatomic) float depth
```

**Discussion**

Depth value cannot be 0 (zero) as this will set the default value of 0.5 (`kGC3DFlipTransitionStyle_iBooks`). For a very small depth value use `kGC3DFlipTransitionStyle_Horizontal`.

There are three constant keys set in the header file:

```objectivec
extern float kGC3DFlipTransitionStyle_Horizontal
```

Very small depth like Apple's transition style animation `UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal`. To see how it looks like, take a look at the [screenshot](https://github.com/GlennChiu/GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue#screenshots).

```objectivec
extern float kGC3DFlipTransitionStyle_iTunesU
```

Depth value set like the iTunes U app (bit smaller than iBooks).

```objectivec
extern float kGC3DFlipTransitionStyle_iBooks
```

Dept value set like the iBooks (and Podcasts) app. This is the default value.

### - disableLightEffect

This property disables the light effect.

```objectivec
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL disableLightEffect
```

**Discussion**

Disabling the light effect allows the animation to mimic Apple's 3D flip transition animation. It does not have an effect on performance. Light effect is enabled by default.
To see how it looks like, take a look at the [screenshot](https://github.com/GlennChiu/GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue#screenshots).

### - disableMultisampling

This property disables 4x multisampling anti-aliasing (4x MSAA).

```objectivec
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL disableMultisampling
```

**Discussion**

Multisampling improves image quality. It is enabled by default. Disable it for slightly better performance on older devices.

### Example

This is an example on how to set the segue properties:

```objectivec
- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
{
    if ([segue isKindOfClass:[GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue class]])
    {
        GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue *flipSegue = (GC3DFlipTransitionStyleSegue *)segue;
        flipSegue.disableLightEffect = YES;
        flipSegue.disableMultisampling = YES;
        flipSegue.depth = kGC3DFlipTransitionStyle_iTunesU;
    }
}
```

Todo
----
- Add option to flip view controllers in opposite direction like Apple's Podcasts app.
- Improve snapshot performance on the iPad.
